Introducing an application designed for the management of hospital radioactive solid waste, developed using MIT's App Inventor platform. This application has been crafted in accordance with the guidelines set by the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy, which adhere to the IAEA's TECDOC 1000 document from 1998 and the WHO's 'Safe Management of Wastes from Healthcare Activities' report of 1999.

The primary functionality of this application revolves around the selection and management of radioactive waste generated within hospital settings. Users can choose the specific radionuclide involved, specify the source location, select the appropriate container type, input the dose rate in microsieverts per hour at a distance of 10 cm from the waste, and provide the waste's weight.

A key feature of the app is its capability to perform accurate calculations. Based on user-provided data, the application can calculate the waste's activity, activity concentration, and the required storage time. This offers users a clearer understanding of the waste's radioactive nature and properties, which is vital for its safe handling and disposal.

Beyond its calculation functionality, the app also facilitates the management of generated solid waste. It offers a logging function that allows users to keep a detailed record of the handled and disposed waste. This feature is essential for regulatory compliance and ensuring transparency in the management of radioactive waste.
